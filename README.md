👋 Hey! My name is Correy, and I primarily have a background in modern web development. When writing code, I'm an
advocate for [empathetic code reviews with fewer nitpicks](https://blog.danlew.net/2021/02/23/stop-nitpicking-in-code-reviews/),
[well structured commits](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) ✨, and fitting a
problem to a tool, rather than fitting a tool to a problem 🛠️.

In late 2022 to July 2024, I helped bolster Apryse's Security Operations team, creating a foundation for a
stronger Vulnerability Management program by standardizing and integrating [Static Composition Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis)
and [Static Application Security Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing) tooling
into the various SDLC pipelines across the organization.

Between 2020-2022, I was a [Solution Engineer](https://medium.com/@safonand/what-is-a-technical-solutions-engineer-e3d4324efec)
at Apryse, acting as the primary technical contact for prospective and existing clients on Apryse's various Document SDK
solutions, many of which focused on Apryse's flagship [JavaScript WebViewer SDK](https://showcase.apryse.com/) product. I
continued to hone my development skills by quickly fixing potential bugs found by constiuents, and contributing new features to
WebViewer when prospects had a greater potential to license the software if the new feature was implemented.

During Sales calls with Account Executives, rather than routine and canned demos, my approach always looked to uncover
the underlying pains and problems prospective or existing clients were trying to solve, and determining ways in which
Apryse's SDK offerings could be applied to those problems with a subsequent live demo. I always considered the depth
of the technical background knowledge of the audience, and my presentations were catered accordingly.

From 2017-2020, over at the [BC Cancer Agency - Genome Sciences Centre](https://bcgsc.ca/), I spent a lot of my time building
`React` applications, mostly in Javascript, but some in Typescript. I've built back-ends using `ExpressJS` and `Python` frameworks,
and hooked up these various back-ends to `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL` and `MS-SQL` databases

I cut my teeth on `C` and `C++` throughout uni, so I'm always ready to jump into
systems level programming in [`C++`](https://github.com/CorreyL/DSRC) and
[`Java`](https://github.com/bcgsc/qupath-annotation-exchange) when I need to.
If time permitted, I'd be onboard with learning more about `Rust` and `Go`.
